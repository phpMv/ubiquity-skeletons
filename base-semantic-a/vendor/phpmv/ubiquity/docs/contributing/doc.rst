Documenting guide
=================

Ubiquity has two main sets of documentation: 

- the guides, which help you learn about manipulations or concepts ;
- and the API, which serves as a reference for coding.

You can help improve the Ubiquity guides by making them more coherent, consistent, or readable, adding missing information, correcting factual errors, fixing typos, or bringing them up to date with the latest Ubiquity version.

To do so, make changes to Ubiquity guides source files (located here on GitHub). Then open a pull request to apply your changes to the master branch.

When working with documentation, please take into account the guidelines.

.. info::
   To help our CI servers you should add [ci skip] to your documentation commit message to skip build on that commit. |br|
   Please remember to use it for commits containing only documentation changes.
